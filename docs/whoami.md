    My name is Sebastiano Morson, and I am a simple chronic procrastinator from the neighborhood, born and raised in Friuli Venezia Giulia.

    If you've wondered why it says justAMonkey at the top, it's not the website's brand, but rather my nickname. Each of us in life will face problems that seem insurmountable, believing that our life is either worthless or, conversely, more valuable than another's. In those moments, I try to change perspective and remember that I am just a more evolved monkey: nothing more, nothing less. I am justAMonkey.

    In my free time, I am also a master's student in the international double degree program in Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity at the University of Udine; a member of the cybersecurity group at my university, the MadrHacks; a photography enthusiast, and many other things that I periodically stop doing and then resume days, weeks, or months later.

If anyone is wondering what the image should represent, well, it's a painting by Sigmar Polke. He likes to paint paintings over other paintings. I tried to imitate him and inserted my image exactly under his painting, so only those who have an idea of how a website works can see it.
