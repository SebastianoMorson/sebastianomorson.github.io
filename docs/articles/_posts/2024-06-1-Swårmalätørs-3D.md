This project can be found on my GitHub page ([https://github.com/SebastianoMorson/Swarmsim-3d](https://github.com/SebastianoMorson/Swarmsim-3d))

Swarmsim-3d is a project realized for Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt.

The aim of this project was to improve the existing simulator realized by Professor Dirk Brockmann from University of Berlin, following the most recent articles about synchronization of swarmalators, published by Professor Christian Bettstetter and his team, and scientific community in general.
